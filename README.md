# Garden 5 Minute Quickstart Example

This is the GitHub repo for the example project from our [5 minute quickstart guide](https://docs.garden.io/basics/5-min-quickstart).

We encourage you to follow the steps of the guide before deploying the project.

## Deploying the project

> Make sure you have Garden installed and Kubernetes running locally (e.g. with Minikube or Docker for Desktop) before deploying the project.

First clone this repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/garden-io/quickstart-example.git
```

Then deploy the project in dev mode by running the following from anywhere in the project directory:

```
garden deploy --dev
```

You can now visit the example project at http://vote.local.demo.garden.

The project itself doubles as an interactive guide that walks you through some common Garden commands and workflows. We encourage you to give it a spin!
