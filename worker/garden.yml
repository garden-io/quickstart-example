# Here we're using the container type which means Garden will generate the manifests.
# We generally recommend using the 'kubernetes' or 'helm' types if you already have manifests
# or charts at hand but the 'container' type can be a good way to get started quickly if you don't.
# You can learn more about the Kubernetes action types here: https://docs.garden.io/kubernetes-plugins/action-types
